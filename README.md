# ArchiveSystem
that's my first ever project that i work on alone for 5 months now 
the stroy behinde it is: 
to creat an archive system that take a number of pictures 
from a scanner on spicfic File Number with a type and Date of the papers
ex: file number 121, type "BlahBlah#4", Date 14/4/2020 has 16 papers init
    file number 121, type "BlahBlah#15", Date 11/2/2019 has 10 papers ect....
that's the main idea then i added some main helpers forms 
as the edit to add files to the main file scanner form
       quality to check if the file had some missing pappers or anything wrong
       search to view the file content 
       // SUB FORMS ⛩️ //
       logs to view users logs
       reports to see how many file has been scanned from each user
       adds like owner name, files types, city name ect...
       user manager add users with spicfic vlidation : admin, entry, quality ect...
       
       // more forms to be explined
